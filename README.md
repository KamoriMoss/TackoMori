### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!-- Hello My name is Kamori Moss and I am a student at GSU. I am currently studying Computer Information Systems. I'm looking forward to earning an internship and practicing some of the languages I've currently been learning. I code in Python, R, and SQL. I also have experience creating visualizations in Tableau and Excel, however, I will continue to code because I love learning new languages and gaining new project experience.
